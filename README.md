Git repo for Orbital 2020

We are using an open-source modular framework, Cube.js, to build the main analytics dashboard / control panel for the users. 
Cube.js is run back-end as a service, managing the connection to a mySQL database and pre-aggregation, query-queueing and more.
Cube.js also exposes an API for our front-end application, allowing us to build customised dashboards and other analytics features. Using ReactJS, we are able to customise the user interface of the analytics dashboard.
